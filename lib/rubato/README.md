Basically like [awestore](https://github.com/K4rakara/awestore) but not really.

Join the cool curve crew

The general premise of this is that I don't understand how awestore works. That and I really wanted
to be able to have an interpolator that didn't have a set time. That being said, I haven't made an
interpolator that doesn't have a set time yet, so I just have this instead. It has a similar
function to awestore but the method in which you actually go about doing the easing is very
different.

In this case, you essentially construct a graph of the slope you want for easing. The reason for
that is, if you are working with the derivative the whole time, you can make transitions between
slopes (basically interruptions of the animation) completely smooth. The only things you really need
to supply are the duration of the animation, the duration of the intro, and the easing function, but
much more is configurable.

Essentially, it takes a curve like this

![Example Slope Curve](./images/slope_graph.png)

and turns it into its antiderivative, which looks something like this

![Example Normal Graph](./images/normal_graph.png)

which is just the antiderivative, and is beautifully eased. The length of the `y=Â±x` varies based
off of the intro duration and the exact function used depends on the easing you give it. The maximum
height of the function is generated on the fly via this wonderful formula:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{blue}m=\frac{d %2B ib(F_i(1)-1)}{i(F_i(1)-1) %2B o(F_o(1)-1) %2B t}" height=50>

where `i` is intro duration, `F_i` is the antiderivative of the intro easing function, `o` is outro
duration, `F_o` is the antiderivative of the outro easing function, `d` is the total distance needed
to be traveled, `b` is the initial slope, and `t` is the total duration. How does this formula work?
Magic (if you're actually interested, for some ungodly reason feel free to ask). How did I find it?
Also magic (hours of staring at xournal++ and debugging).

Okay so this is what it looks like in action

```lua
--what I actually use for my workspaces
timed = rubato.timed {
	intro = 0.1,
	duration = 0.3
}

--to actually make it do something
timed.target = 3
```

![Normal Easing](./images/trapezoid_easing.gif)

This is very subtly eased, however. A much more pronounced easing would look more like this:

```lua
timed = rubato.timed {
	intro = 0.5,
	duration = 1,
	easing = rubato.quadratic --quadratic slope, not easing
}
```

![Quadratic Easing](./images/quadratic_easing.gif)

The first is the same trapezoid I had shown earlier, except the distance is different. The second's
slope curve looks more like the one shown below. Note the lack of a plateau and longer duration
which gives the more pronounced easing:

<h1 id="b-w-t">But why though?</h1>

Why go through all this hastle? Why not just use awestore? That's a good question and to be fair you
can use whatever interpolator you so choose.  However, rubato does have one advantage, which is that
interruptions are as perfect as can be. It conserves the current position and slope of the previous
animation when you start a new one, and even allows you to use a custom specific easing animation
for interruptions. Basically the interruptions are mathematically as smooth as you can possibly make
them. Kinda.

Furthermore, if you use rubato, you get to brag about how annoying it was to set up a monstrous
derivative just to write a custom easing function, like the one shown in [Custom Easing
Function](#c-e-f)'s example. That's a benefit, not a downside, I promise.

Also maybe hopefully the code should be almost digestible kinda maybe. I tried my best to comment
and documentate, but I actually have no idea how to do lua docs or luarocks or anything.

Also it has a cooler name

<h1 id="a-and-m">Arguments and Methods</h1>

**For rubato.timed**:

Arguments (in the form of a table):
 - `duration`: the total duration of the animation
 - `rate`: the number of times per second the timer executes. Higher rates mean
   smoother animations and less error.
 - `pos`: the initial position of the animation (def. `0`)
 - `intro`: the duration of the intro
 - `outro`: the duration of the outro (def. same as `intro`\*)
 - `inter`: the duration of the between-animation time (def. same as `intro`)
 - `prop_intro`: When `true`, `intro`, `outro` and `inter` represent proportional
   values; 0.5 would be half the duration. (def. `false`)
 - `easing`: the easing table (def. `interpolate.linear`)
 - `easing_outro`: the outro easing table (def. as `easing`)
 - `easing_inter`: the "intermittent" easing function, which defines which
   easing to use in the case of animation interruptions (def. same as
   `easing`)
 - `subscribed`: a function to subscribe at initialization (def. `nil`)
 - `override_simulate`: when `true`, will simulate everything instead of just
   when `dx` and `b` have opposite signs at the cost of having to do a little
   more work (and making my hard work on finding the formula for `m` worthless 
   :slightly_frowning_face:) (def. `false`)
 - `awestore_compat`: Make api even *more* similar to awestore's (def. `false`)

All of these values (except awestore_compat and subscribed) are mutable and changing them will
change how the animation looks. I do not suggest changing `pos`, however, unless you change the
position of what's going to be animated in some other way

\*with the caviat that if the outro being the same as the intro would result in an error, it would go
for the largest allowable outro time. Ex: duration = 1, intro = 0.6, then outro will default to 0.4.

Useful properties:
 - `target`: when set, sets the target and starts the animation, otherwise returns the target
 - `state`: immutable, returns true if an animation is in progress

Methods are as follows:
 - `timed:subscribe(func)`: subscribe a function to be ran every refresh of the animation
 - `timed:unsubscribe(func)`: unsubscribe a function
 - `timed:abort()`: stop the animation
 - `timed:restart()`: restart the animaiton from it's approximate initial state (if a value is 
 changed during the animation it will remain changed after calling restart)

Awestore compatibility functions (`awestore_compat` must be true):
 - `timed:set(target_new)`: sets the position the animation should go to, effectively the same 
 as setting target
 - `timed:initial()`: returns the intiial position
 - `timed:last()`: returns the target position, effectively the same as `timed.target`

Awestore compatibility properties:
 - `started`: subscribable table which is called when the animation starts or is interrupted
   + `started:subscribe(func)`: subscribes a function
   + `started:unsubscribe(func)`: unsubscribes a function
 - `ended`: subscribable table which is called when the animation ends
   + `ended:subscribe(func)`: subscribes a function
   + `ended:unsubscribe(func)`: unsubscribes a function

**builtin easing functions**
 - `easing.zero`: linear easing, zero slope
 - `easing.linear`: linear slope, quadratic easing
 - `easing.quadratic`: quadratic slope, cubic easing
 - `easing.bouncy`: the bouncy thing as shown in the example

<h1 id="c-e-f">Custom Easing Functions</h1>

To make a custom easing function, it's pretty easy. You just need a table with two values:

 - `easing`, which is the function of the slope curve you want. So if you want quadratic easing
   you'd take the derivative, which would result in linear easing. **Important:** `f(0)=0` and
   `f(1)=1` must be true for it to look nice.
 - `F`, which is basically just the value of the antiderivative of the easing function at `x=1`.
   This is the antiderivative of the scaled function (such that (0, 0) and (1, 1) are in the
   function), however, so be wary of that.

In practice, creating your own easing would look like this:

1. Go to [easings.net](https://easings.net)

For the sake of this tutorial, we'll do an extremely complex easing, "ease in elastic"  

2. Find the necessary information

**Important:** You should really use sagemath or Wolfram Mathematica to get as exact of a derivative
as you can. Wolfram Alpha doesn't cut it. I personally used sagemath because it's actually free,
which is pretty cool. To take that one step further, I'd suggest using jupyter notebook in tandem
with sagemath because if you do `%display latex` you get a super good looking output. If you can't
use jupyter (or don't want to), `%display ascii_art` is a pretty cool alternative.

The initial function, given by [easings.net](https://easings.net), is as follows:  
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{blue}f(x)=-2^{10 \, x - 10}\times \sin\left(-\frac{43}{6} \, \pi %2B \frac{20}{3} \, \pi x\right))">

The derivative (via sagemath) is as follows:  
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{blue}f^\prime (x)=-\frac{5}{3} \, {\left(2 \, \pi \cos\left(-\frac{43}{6} \, \pi %2B \frac{20}{3} \, \pi x\right) %2B 3 \, \log\left(2\right) \sin\left(-\frac{43}{6} \, \pi %2B \frac{20}{3} \, \pi x\right)\right)}\times 2^{10 \, x - 9}">

First we double check that `f'(0)=0`, which in this case it is not.  
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{blue}f^\prime (0)=\frac{5}{1536} \, \sqrt{3} \pi - \frac{5}{1024} \, \log\left(2\right)">

so now we subtract `f'(0)` from `f'(x)` and get a pretty messy function, let's say `f_2(x)`.
Regrettably, we're about to mess up that function a little more.  Next we check that `f_2(1)=1`. In
this case, once again, it doesn't. We get  
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{blue}f_2(1)=-\frac{5}{3072} \, \sqrt{3} {\left(2 \, \pi - 2049 \, \sqrt{3}\times \log\left(2\right)\right)}">

So now we divide our `f(x)` by `f(1)`, to get our final function, `f_e(x)` (easing function) (I am
so good at naming these kinds of things)  
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{blue}f_e(x)=\frac{6 \, \pi %2B \sqrt{3} \pi \times 2^{10 \, x %2B 2}\times \cos\left(-\frac{43}{6} \, \pi %2B \frac{20}{3} \, \pi x\right) %2B 3 \, \sqrt{3}\times 2^{10 \, x %2B 1}\times \log\left(2\right) \sin\left(-\frac{43}{6} \, \pi %2B \frac{20}{3} \, \pi x\right) - 3 \, \sqrt{3}\times \log\left(2\right)}{3 \, {\left(2 \, \pi - 2049 \, \sqrt{3} \times\log\left(2\right)\right)}}">

Great... This is going to be a treat to write as lua... Anyways, our final step is to find the
definite integral from 0 to 1 of our `f(x)`, which is this  
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{blue}\int_0^1 f_e(x) \,dx=\frac{20 \, \pi - 10 \, \sqrt{3}\times \log\left(2\right) - 2049 \, \sqrt{3}}{10 \, {\left(2 \, \pi - 2049 \, \sqrt{3}\times \log\left(2\right)\right)}}">

Now I'm sure that looks pretty daunting. However, these functions are kinda stupidly easy to find
with sagemath. You basically only have to run these commands:

```python
from sage.symbolic.integration.integral import definite_integral
function('f')
f(x)=factor(derivative('''your function goes here''', x))
f(x)=factor(f(x)-f(0))
f(x)=factor(f(x)/f(1))
print(f(x)) # easing
print(definite_integral(f(x), x, 0, 1)) # F
```

which will tell you all you need to know.

It's important to use the `factor(...)` thing because otherwise you may end up with decimals, which
really should be avoided if possible. When I didn't do factor, there were 0.499999s which makes it
decently less accurate and substantially more complicated.

4. Now we just have to translate this into an actual lua table. You might want to be careful about
   not doing more operations than necessary but honestly it probably doesn't much matter.

```lua
--all the constants are calculated only once
local cs = {
	c1 = 6 * math.pi - 3 * math.sqrt(3) * math.log(2),
	c2 = math.sqrt(3) * math.pi,
	c3 = 6 * math.sqrt(3) * math.log(2),
	c4 = 6 * math.pi - 6147 * math.sqrt(3) * math.log(2),
	c5 = 46 * math.pi / 6
}

bouncy = {
	F = (20 * math.pi - (10 * math.log(2) - 2049) * math.sqrt(3)) / 
		(20 * math.pi - 20490 * math.sqrt(3) * math.log(2)),
	easing = function(t)
		--short circuit
		if t == 0 then return 0 end
		if t == 1 then return 1 end

		--both of these values are reused
		local c1 = (20 * t * math.pi) / 3 - cs.c5
		local c2 = math.pow(2, 10 * t + 1) --in the 2^{10x+2} I factored out the 2 to calculate this once
		return (cs.c1 + cs.c2 * c2 * math.cos(c1) + cs.c3 * c2 * math.sin(c1)) / cs.c4
	end
}

timed = rubato.timed {
	intro = 0, --we'll use this as an outro, since it's weird as an intro
	outro = 0.7,
	duration = 1,
	easing = bouncy
}
```

We did it! Now to check whether or not it actually works

![Beautiful](./images/beautiful.gif)

While you can't see its full glory in 25 fps gif form, it really is pretty cool.  Furthermore, if it
works with *that* function, it'll probably work with anything. As long as you have the correct
antiderivative and it's properly scaled, you can probably use any (real, differentiable) function
under the sun.

Note that if it's not properly scaled, this can be worked around (if you're lazy and don't care
about a minor performance decrease). You can set `override_simulaton` to true. However, it is
possible that it will not perform exactly as you expected if you do this so do your best to just
find the derivative and antiderivative of the derivative.

<h1 id="install">Installation</h1>

So actually telling people how to install this is important, isn't it

It supports luarocks, so that'll cut it if you want a really really easy install, but it'll install
it in some faraway lua bin where you'll probably leave it forever if you either stop using rubato or
stop using awesome. However, it's certainly the easiest way to go about it.

```
luarocks install rubato
```

Otherwise, somewhere in your awesome directory, (I use `~/.config/awesome/lib`) you can run this
command: 

```
git clone https://github.com/andOrlando/rubato.git
```

Then, whenever you actually want to use rubato, do this at the start of the lua file: `local rubato
= require "lib.rubato"`

<h1 id="name">Why the name?</h1>

Beacuse I play piano so this kinda links up with other stuff I do, and rubato really well fits the
project. In music, it means "push and pull of tempo" basically, which really is waht easing is all
about in the first place. Plus, it'll be the first of my projects without garbage names
("minesweperSweeper," "Latin Learning").

<h1 id="todo">Todo</h1>
